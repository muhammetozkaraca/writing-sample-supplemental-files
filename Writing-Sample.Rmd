{\bf Abstract}

\end{centering}


$\qquad$ The emergence of the Islamic State and Salafi extremist organizations has hastened the global spread of religious terrorism. While scholars have given considerable attention to the origins and motivations of religious terror groups, particularly since 9/11, a significant gap exists in the pertinent literature, with relatively few studies ever questioning the relationship between secularism and religious terrorism. This study seeks to address this void by asking whether constitutionally recognized secular values thwart the occurrence of faith-based violence. Applying insights from the inclusion and moderation thesis, it argues that constitutionally recognized secular principles are vital for countries to deter religious groups from resorting to violence by ensuring these groups’ freedom to practice religious rituals. To substantiate the assumption, evidence was obtained from a variety of sources. After adjusting for the impact of secularism on the occurrence of religious terror attacks using several confounding variables, the negative binomial regression results partially corroborate that faith-based terrorism occurs less frequently in constitutionally secular countries. Furthermore, the case study of Turkey illustrates how constitutionally acknowledged secular principles frustrate the potential breeding ground for extremist groups to radicalize moderates. Considering the massive economic and human costs associated with faith-based terror attacks, the study’s conclusions provide crucial insights into the origins of faith-based terrorism and offer critical guidance on how to combat it.

# Introduction

$\qquad$ The 9/11 terror attacks that were carried out by Al-Qaeda stunned the world with the brutality that they inflicted upon civilians. Although terrorism had not been a novel concept to many scholars until then, scholars of Political Science and International Relations have paid close attention to the subject of religious terrorism since the 9/11 attacks. Why this incident generated such peculiar attention was veiled behind the means and goals of this new type of political violence that the 9/11 strikes resembled. 

$\qquad$ Unlike previous waves of terrorism, this new wave of political aggression had theological goals based on religious values and traditions that were previously thought to be eradicating in the global sphere. Religious terrorism has started to accelerate at a time when several scholars, under the influence of long-established secularization theory, have predicated that the perennial role of religion in social life will erode as countries become modernized and industrialized [@bellah_religious_1964; @parsons_1965_1966; @fenn_process_1970; @luckmann_structural_1979; @wilson_contemporary_1979; @tschannen_secularization_1991; @berger_sacred_2011]. Nevertheless, the course of events that the world witnessed during the last part of the century seemed to form a glaring contradiction with their postulations. While some countries advanced economically and appeared to be westernized, the influence of religion in social and political life in these contexts did not vanish. Furthermore, even in some instances, the particular developments, like the Iranian Islamic Revolution, strengthened the role of religion.  

$\qquad$ In this context, the 9/11 attacks can be seen as a prime example of an emerging pattern in faith-based violence accompanied by several subsequent attacks and peaked with the ISIS terror organization in recent times. Nonetheless, neither the large volume of terrorism studies nor the literature on secularization theory makes a substantial attempt to question the link between secularism and religious terrorism. To fill this void in the existing literature, this study inquires whether constitutionally recognized secular values thwart the occurrence of faith-based violence.

$\qquad$ To address the gap, this dissertation examines the relationship between secularism and religious terrorism. At its core, it traces the roots of religion’s involvement in political violence along with examining the historical development of secularization theory. Valuable insights from the long-established inclusion and moderation thesis are applied to fathom the nature of the purported relationships. The core tenets of this thesis stretch all the way back to the debates in the early 1910s about the transformation of socialist parties to more representative structures [@michels_political_1966; @tepe_inclusion-moderation_2019]. The theory is mainly predicated on the assumption that competitive democratic processes constrain extremist ideas by turning radical organizations into more compromising ones. While this thesis has been applied to a variety of contexts, including Christian movements [@nasr_democracy_1995; @wickham_path_2004; @schwedler_faith_2006; @somer_does_2011; @buehler_revisiting_2013; @jaffrelot_refining_2013; @al-anani_inclusion-moderation_2019], very few studies have attempted to apply it to religious terror groups.

$\qquad$ Therefore, by drawing on the main tenets of the inclusion and moderation thesis, it is argued that constitutionally accepted secular notions ensure religious security for all members of a country by securing its citizens’ right to practice their faiths regardless of what they pray for. In exchange, this situation precludes prospective extremist groups from radicalizing moderates and thus frustrates the potential breeding ground for them. This mechanism eventually leads secular democracies to gain a significant edge in averting religious terror attacks.

$\qquad$ To substantiate the claim, a mixed-methods research design that subsumes quantitative and qualitative techniques, is adopted. Empirical data on the main dependent variables for this study, the occurrence of religious terror attacks per year along with their causalities, is obtained by cross walking between the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and the Extended Data on Terror Groups (EDTG). To this end, negative binomial regression tests are conducted to adjust for the impact of secularism on the occurrence of religious terror attacks and their causalities using several confounding variables. To bolster the reliability of conclusions derived from statistical tests, the case of Turkey, a country well known for its long reputation of hailing secularism and having a Muslim majority population concomitantly, is examined in depth. 

$\qquad$ In this regard, this research seeks to bridge a long-standing gap between secularism and religious terrorism. By examining the causes behind religious terror organizations and their motivations, this study reveals the advantage that secular countries retain against religious terror groups. The conclusions derived from this study contribute to the current body of knowledge by illustrating how secular countries are better equipped to combat religious terror groups and what can be done to deter them. The following section will explore this study’s theoretical foundations along with reviewing the existing literature on the subject. 


\newpage
# Theoretical Conceptions and Analytical Framework

$\qquad$ The purported theoretical framework on the idea of secularism as an antidote to religious terrorism is based upon the long-established theory of inclusion and moderation thesis that has been most notably applied to the cases of Islamic parties [@nasr_democracy_1995; @wickham_path_2004; @schwedler_faith_2006; @somer_does_2011; @buehler_revisiting_2013; @jaffrelot_refining_2013; @al-anani_inclusion-moderation_2019]. Although a few other studies have applied this theory in other contexts as well [@kalyvas_rise_1996; @kalyvas_commitment_2000; @lewis_inclusion-moderation_2019], the core tenets of this idea stretch all the way back to the debate in the early 1910s about the transformation of socialist parties to more representative structures [@michels_political_1966; @tepe_inclusion-moderation_2019]. In its basic sense, the inclusion and moderation thesis is predicated on the premise that competitive democratic processes constrain extremist ideas by turning radical organizations into more compromising ones. Thus, when fundamentalist parties are allowed to compete in elections, the theory suggests that political mechanisms and compromises pull them away from the edges of the political spectrum and these parties become situated in positions that are more accessible to larger groups of people [@tepe_inclusion-moderation_2019].

$\qquad$ In this regard, despite the critiques leveled at the theory for many years, its implementation in a variety of contexts, including democratization processes, has garnered considerable interest [@huntington_third_1993]. However, the theory’s application to the subject of religious terrorism has received little attention in the existing literature. Relying on the main postulations of inclusion and moderation thesis as a springboard, this part will explain how secularism is an effective instrument for combating religious terrorism, which will also serve as the analytical framework for this study. 

## Analytical Framework 

$\qquad$ To begin with, this study’s analytical framework is predicated on the proposition that constitutionally accepted secular notions guarantee religious groups the right to practice their distinct lifestyles. As a result, these clauses avert political authorities from suppressing religious factions based on their sect. Furthermore, such clauses facilitate all faith groups to participate in decision-making processes as equal stakeholders, since in secular countries, no group can be discriminated against in political processes based on its convictions. Thus, as no religious cult is upheld and everyone is equal before the law regardless of their faith, even though political contradictions might occur with regard to religious practices, legally recognized secular notions beget the resolution of potential contradictions through democratic means. By this way, secular countries obtain a distinct advantage in settling faith-based tensions thanks to the separation of religious and state affairs. 

$\qquad$ Accordingly, as the political and legal rights of all types of sects are secured through constitutional amendments in secular countries, no faith-based organization needs to resort to political violence either to protect or to practice its own way of life. This absence of a necessity for violent methods eventually obstructs potential extremist groups’ ability to manipulate moderates and garner support for the sake of protecting religious practices. Therefore, the inclusion of all faith-based groups, through guaranteeing their right to religious practices, yields countries a distinct advantage in inhibiting religious terrorism. Figure \ref{fig:scheme} illustrates the asserted mechanism in this regard.

```

```{=latex}
\caption{The Operational Mechanism \label{fig:scheme}}
\raggedright\textit{Source}: See text.
\end{figure}
```

$\qquad$ At this point, it should be noted that, while the original inclusion and moderation thesis contends that electoral concerns are the primary motivator for extremist groups to moderate [@yadav_understanding_2010; @tepe_inclusion-moderation_2019], the scheme in this study asserts that legal protection of religious rights, which can be delivered through constitutionally recognized secular concepts, is the primary tool that deters potential fundamentalists from resorting to violence. Thus, rather than electoral benefits, it is argued that the constitutional protections afforded to religious organizations are suﬀicient to deter religious violence. As no faith-based clique would need to resort to violence in such an environment, the prospective breeding ground for extremism will be stifled, and religious terrorism will be averted. 

$\qquad$ This scheme has several essential assumptions. First of all, along with Hoffman [-@hoffman_inside_2006], it is assumed that terrorism is a political act. This is essential for the purported process as it is presumed that actors participating in religious terror activities conduct their actions to become more visible in the public sphere and gain concession from the political authorities. In other words, while religion plays a significant role in their motivation, it is argued that religious terror organizations employ terrorism to secure political concessions necessary to preserve their particular way of life. Thus, their positions are bolstered in circumstances when religious oppression occurs in the public sphere, since they provide possible justifications for individuals to resort to violence in the public realm in order to get concessions necessary to protect their distinctive way of life. 

$\qquad$ Along with the above premise, it is also aﬀirmed that constitutionally accepted secular notions provide concrete guarantees to every individual in society to pursue their religion by detaching faith from politics. However, it might be a thick assumption in the sense that various kinds of secularism exist across countries [@kuru_passive_2007; @kuru_analyzing_2009]. For instance, following Dobbelaere’s [-@dobbelaere_secularization_2004] and Roberts and Yamane’s [-@roberts_religion_2016] classifications, the notion of secularism can be explored at three levels, which are: society and language as the macro-level; organization at the state as the mezzo-level; and individual as the micro-level. The use of the mezzo-level approach in this study is largely motivated by the aforementioned mechanism. Secular governments, in their simplest form, declare neutrality against all religions represented in society [@stolz_secularization_2019]. By guaranteeing religious rights, secular states cease the need to resort to violence. Thus, the main unit of analysis to examine secularism should be the state-level for this study. 

$\qquad$ Although it might be argued that excessive forms of secularism might envy religious practices and become an impediment to the integration of heterogeneous societies [@freedman_secularism_2004], to the best of the knowledge, there is no previous demonstrated link between the exclusionary version of secularism and any type of terrorism, including but not limited to religious terrorism. 

$\qquad$ It should also be noted that the asserted mechanism only extends to cases where the aforementioned assumptions that are explored in detail above exist. Therefore, in instances in which external factors play important roles, such as in the Afghan context during and after the Soviet invasion [@johnson_understanding_2007; @attewell_factory_2018], the mechanism cannot be operationalized, as in these circumstances, religious terror activities do not originate solely from the high tensions between local people whose faiths are surpassed and the central political authorities. In cases like Afghanistan, there might be different motivations behind religious terror groups to be active due to the different contextual circumstances, such as punishing governments who collaborated with the so-called infidels. For instance, on a similar research subject, after controlling the impact of several economic development, infrastructure, geographic, security, and cultural factors, Piazza [-@piazza_opium_2012] finds that opium production is a more reliable predictor of terrorism compared to other potential causes in the case of Afghanistan. Furthermore, in these incidents, faith-based terror groups might even be manipulated by third parties for the sake of political or economic interests [@reuveny_afghanistan_1999; @findley_rethinking_2006]. Thus, in cases similar to Afghanistan in which external parties are involved in the conflicts by manipulating pressures on religious practices and turning them into means to rally the masses for the sake of their different political goals, the purported mechanism cannot be operationalized. 

$\qquad$ To summarize, this part delves into the analytical framework of this study in detail by referencing the study’s major assumptions. The following chapter will examine the principles of prospective research design in order to assess the validity of the process described in this section. 

\newpage

# Research Design

$\qquad$ On the basis of the purported scheme discussed in detail in [Section 2.1][Analytical Framework], in this section, the research design is elucidated. For this purpose, the dependent variables for this study are the total number of religious terror attacks and the overall number of people killed by these attacks in a given year for every country. The main reason why two dependent variables are employed in this study is basically related to the possibility that while the total number of attacks in a given year might be high, the causalities of these attacks can be low and vice versa. Given that focusing on conclusions derived from only one of the two might lead to biased conclusions in such cases, it is thought it is better to consider both concurrently for more reliable interpretations.

$\qquad$ Therefore, to detect these numbers, religious terror groups are primarily derived from the “Extended Data on Terrorist Groups (EDTG)” dataset [-@hou_introducing_2020], which classifies terrorist organizations’ ideological motivations according to perpetrator groups’ political stance based on the convention of Jones and Libicki [-@jones_how_2008]. In this regard, there are two essential reasons to employ the EDTG dataset in this study. First, it is the largest dataset, to the best of the knowledge, that classifies terror groups according to their ideological perspective. Furthermore, while this dataset includes groups that ceased their operations or maintained to function between 1970 and 2016, as another convenient feature, the EDTG data is tied to the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) [-@noauthor_global_2020], which is the most comprehensive dataset, to the best of the knowledge, with regard to listing all particular terror events along with their details, such as the number of causalities and exact coordinates of attacks. This allows to observe the specific events that were perpetrated by the religious terror groups coded in the EDTG dataset. Thus, as the dependent variable for this study, the intensity of religious terrorism is explored by inspecting the frequency of attacks and the overall number of people killed as a result of these incidents for every country in a given year. 

$\qquad$ The primary independent variable for this study is the existence of secular notions in countries’ constitutions. For this purpose, the Religion and State (RAS 3) [-@fox_secularreligious_2016] dataset,which covers all the religious regulations embedded in 117 countries’ constitutions between 1990 and 2014, is utilized. To this end, the particular variable of *Separation of Religion and State* from the RAS 3, which probes constitutionally recognized religious clauses across countries and classifies them on 3-level scales, is used in this study.^[The *Separation of Religion and State* variable is coded as 0: “The State has no oﬀicial religion,” 1: “The State has multiple established religions,” 2: “The State has one established religion.”]

$\qquad$ In addition to operationalizing the *Separation of Religion and State* variable as the primary independent variable, the impact of secularism is controlled along with two other variables in the RAS dataset. For this purpose, the *Official Support* variable, which measures the state’s formal relationship with religion, is used. As this variable contains several codings for states with and without oﬀicial religions, it is aggregated into a dichotomous format in which 1 represents the existence of either specific hostility or negative attitude of the state and 0 refers to the lack of such a clause. Additionally, the *Restrictions on Religious Political Parties* variable is used to adjust the sole impact of secular constitutions. This variable encodes states’ legal restrictions on religious political parties in four levels.^[The four levels encoded in the *Restrictions on Religious Political Parties* are as follows: 0: “No restrictions,” 1: “Slight restrictions including practical restrictions or the government engages in this activity rarely and on a small scale,” 2: “Significant restrictions including practical restrictions or the government engages in this activity occasionally and on a moderate scale,” 3: “The activity is illegal or the government engages in this activity often and on a large scale.” ]   

$\qquad$ This research also includes several additional variables to control the robustness of the purported claim. Following the previous literature of the impact of economic poverty on terrorism [@krueger_education_2003; @abadie_poverty_2006; @piazza_rooted_2006; @piazza_poverty_2011], the effect of countries’ economic status is controlled by *Logged GDP per Capita* variable which is taken from the World Bank Databank [-@noauthor_databank_2021]. Following Piazza [-@piazza_incubators_2008], to adjust the countries’ state capacities and the role of military power, the World Bank’s [-@noauthor_databank_2021] *Military Spending* variable and the State Fragility Index (2018), which range from 0 (No Fragility) to 25 (Extreme Fragility), are used. In light of previous discussions on the conditioning effect of political regimes on terrorism [@eubank_does_1994; @li_does_2005; @chenoweth_terrorism_2013; @magen_fighting_2018; @bogaards_kinder_2020], the impact of countries’ democratic levels on religious terrorism is also incorporated into the study by utilizing the Polity V dataset’s [-@marshal_polity5_2020] *Combined Polity Score*. This score is measured by subtracting countries’ autocracy scores from democracy scores and ranges from -10 (Strongly Democratic) to +10 (Strongly Autocratic). 

$\qquad$ Finally, to test whether the study’s results can be applicable in the context of Muslim majority countries, where secular principles are not common compared to other regions and religious terrorism is accelerating, the data is subsetted to only Muslim majority countries. As no longitudinal dataset clarifying countries’ population distribution in terms of religious preferences exists, to the best of the knowledge, only the countries that are members of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation are included. In total, these countries amount to 57. The following section lays down the results of the empirical investigations.

# Empirical Investigation

## Geographical distribution of Religious Terror Groups

$\qquad$ In this section, the results of the preliminary analysis using the EDTG are illustrated. The main goal is to explore the geographical distribution of religious terror groups’ base country together with the frequency and lethality of their attacks. In line with the coding criteria at the EDTG, a base country is defined as the country where the group originated from.^[According to the EDTG criteria, one group can have more than one base country. Please note that the results demonstrated in this study reflect this situation.] To this end, 203 distinct groups originating from 58 different countries are detected.^[The “base” columns for two organizations are updated to “Palestine” instead of “West Bank/Gaza” in the original dataset due to the availability of geographical location data.] Thus, Figure \ref{fig:map_web} illustrates the spatial spread of religious terror groups identified in the EDTG dataset.

$\qquad$ A few striking patterns can be explored in this graph. Most notably, no religious terror organizations have originated in the Latin American region. Along with this, the majority of Asian nations, with the exception of the continent's southern half, have a low presence of religious terror groups. In terms of the organizations’ base countries, they primarily originate from the Middle East and North African region. In this regard, the case study of this research has two designated religious terror organizations, which are denoted as "People’s Liberation Army of Kurdistan (ARGK)" and "Turkish Hizballah".^[Although the EDTG codes “People’s Liberation Army of Kurdistan (ARGK)” as a religious terror organization, no evidence was found to support this claim. The author of this paper contacted with the EDTG's owners and they also confirmed this error. Nonetheless, to be consistent with the chosen research design, the group is not dropped from the data.]

$\qquad$ After evaluating the geographical distribution of religious terror organizations, in order to ascertain the frequency and lethality of the specific assaults performed by these groups, an attempt is made to establish connections between the EDTG and the GTD. To this end, an inquiry into the GTD dataset is conducted with the names of 203 religious terror groups that are obtained from the EDTG. Although sometimes the GTD identifies more than one group as responsible for the attack^[Although it is not frequent, the GTD might designate more than one perpetrator group for an attack sometimes. In such cases, these groups’ names are coded in the “gname2” and “gname3” columns. However, as mentioned in the text, to keep the analysis straight, such scenarios are not taken into consideration.], to keep the analysis straightforward, only the groups coded initially in the original dataset are taken into consideration. 

$\qquad$ After matching the EDTG with the GTD and tidying data, 187 groups are detected. ^[These groups’ names along with the total number of attacks and their casualties are listed in the [Appendix A.][Appendix A]] Based on these groups’ names, the whole GTD is subsetted to detect attacks’ dates, geographical locations and the numbers of causalities. Therefore, Figure \ref{fig:facetted} displays the spatial and temporal distribution of the terror activities carried out by religious terror organizations between 1970 and 2019. Take note that the size of the bubbles corresponds to the number of people killed in each attack.

$\qquad$ These graphs contain many eye-catching trends. Primarily, as previous authors noted [@juergensmeyer_terror_2003; @gregg_defining_2014; @rapoport_terrorism_2017], religious terrorism is increasingly gaining momentum on the global stage. While the number of similar assaults and their size in terms of individuals killed were modest in the 1970s, as Figure \ref{fig:facetted} indicates, the frequency and lethality of religious terror acts rose with time, peaking in the previous decade.

$\qquad$ Furthermore, similar to Figure \ref{fig:map_web}, which depicts the geographical distribution of religious terror groups’ base countries, Figure \ref{fig:facetted} illustrates that their strikes are concentrated primarily in the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia regions. Nonetheless, the magnitude of the 9/11 strikes, by their lethality, is still one of the striking details of these maps. Quite intriguingly, Figure \ref{fig:facetted} also demonstrates an increasing pattern of religious terror attacks across the African continent. While the continent was not exposed to such strikes during the 1970s, in line with the trend across the globe, religious terrorism became gradually more common. In the last decade, such attacks on the continent have been concentrated in three geographical areas: the northern part around Libya and Egypt, the African Horn, and the western division.

$\qquad$ The following section employs negative binomial regression tests to ascertain the effect of legally sanctioned secular norms on the number of religious terror acts and their causalities, while controlling for many confounding variables described in [Section 3][Research Design]. 


## Large-N Analyses

$\qquad$ Following the preliminary analysis on religious terror groups’ base countries, their attacks’ distributions, and lethality over the five decades ranging from 1970 to 2019, in this section, negative binomial regression tests are conducted to determine the effect of constitutionally recognized secular norms on the incidence of religious terror attacks and their casualties. To see the general pattern, Figure \ref{fig:final} is made to visualize the relationship between the oﬀicial religious status of countries’ constitutions and the number of attacks as well as the number of killed people in these strikes.

$\qquad$ Figure \ref{fig:final} shows that Finland, the only country with constitutionally recognized multiple official religions, was not a target of religious terror groups. Furthermore, in terms of the number of religious terror attacks and the number of people killed in these attacks, countries with single official religion appear to have higher numbers.

$\qquad$ Now, the investigation proceeds by demonstrating the actual results of negative binomial regression analyses. Through this, the goal is to reveal the exact impact of secularism on religious terrorism by taking several controlling variables into consideration as well. To this end, the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset are demonstrated in Table \ref{tab:descriptive} after omitting NA values.

$\qquad$ Based on Table \ref{tab:descriptive}, it should be noted that several variables in this dataset have high variances. Therefore, neither conducting a multivariate regression analysis nor a poisson regression technique is an appropriate method in this case as they cannot present reliable results due to the distribution of the data. Additionally, recalling from Figure \ref{fig:map_web} and Figure \ref{fig:facetted} that most attacks are clustered in certain regions and the dispersion parameters for both the “Number of Attacks” and the “Total Killed People” are high, an overdispersion exists in the data. Therefore, a negative binomial regression analysis is chosen as a more appropriate method for this study. Following this descriptive analysis, Following this descriptive analysis, Table \ref{tab:regression1} and Table \ref{tab:regression2} demonstrate the results of negative binomial regression analyses.^[To impute the NA values existing in the data, missing factorial variables are calculated using the median of their distribution. For numerical variables, missing values are imputed by calculating the mean of the distribution.]

$\qquad$ To begin with Table \ref{tab:regression1}, which covers results for all states, countries with “Single Official Religion” face more religious terror attacks than other countries. The same can also be said about the relationship between “Single Official Religion” and the number of killed people as a result of these attacks, since the results for this model are statistically significant. Besides, countries with high levels of state fragility index and polity scores, although the latter’s coefficient is relatively small, suffer religious terrorism more.

$\qquad$ Furthermore, some interesting conclusions can be drawn from these results. Countries with high levels of GDP per capita and military spending encounter more religious terror attacks. Given that Western industrialized countries have higher GDP per capita along with higher military spending and jihadists mostly wage attacks against them, these results can be understandable to a certain extent. Nonetheless, further elaboration is needed to detect the exact causes and mechanism behind why religious terror groups target economically more developed countries. Also, quite intriguingly, there is a U-curve relationship between “Restriction on Religious Parties” and religious terror attacks as well as their lethality. Countries with no restrictions on religious parties and countries that ban such parties face fewer religious terror attacks and therefore have a lower level of casualties. While this relationship resembles Chenoweth’s [-@chenoweth_terrorism_2013] conclusions on the general pattern between terrorism and democracy, a deeper analysis is needed to understand the essence of this relationship better. 


$\qquad$ Parallel conclusions can be drawn based on this analysis’s empirical findings for tests conducted exclusively for Muslim majority nations. While having a “Single Official Religion” has a positive impact on the occurrence of “Number of Attacks” and the “Number of Killed People”, this time a U-curve relationship of “Restriction on Religious Parties” cannot be observed. The specific faction of the “Restriction on Religious Parties” variable has a non-significant value. Apart from this exceptional case, Muslim countries with higher levels of state fragility and autocracy encounter religious terrorism more similar to the general trend. While countries with higher GDP per capita experience more religious terrorism, intriguingly, the military spending variable became statistically not significant this time. 

$\qquad$ To summarize, the results of the empirical tests in this study contribute to the existing literature in several ways. It is primarily demonstrated that countries with no officially acknowledged religion have fewer incidence of religious terrorism and suffer marginal human loss. Contrary to this, countries with constitutionally acknowledged religion experience more religious terrorism and human casualties, which corroborates the main assumption of this thesis. Additionally, the results of statistical tests conducted both for all countries and Muslim majority nations have almost parallel results, proving that the conclusions of this study are valid for Muslim majority countries.

$\qquad$ Finally, interesting results are observed in this research which open doors for further studies. First of all, a U-curve relationship between “Restriction on Religious Parties” and religious terror attacks as well as their lethality is detected. While this relationship looks like Chenoweth’s [-@chenoweth_terrorism_2013] study on the relationship between terrorism and democracy, this point needs further elaboration on why countries with almost no restrictions on religious parties and countries that ban such organizations suffer less than others. Additionally, it is demonstrated that countries with higher GDP per capita and military spending face more religious terrorism. While these results contradict several prior studies which draw a relationship between economic poverty and the occurrence of terrorism, this point also needs further elaboration to explicate why the very opposite relationship is illustrated in the case of religious terrorism.
